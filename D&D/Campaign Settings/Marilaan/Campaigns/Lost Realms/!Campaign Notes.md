[[The Forsaken Crypt of Alphal]]:
![[The Forsaken Crypt of Alphal.png]] 

Once the players get close to marker U they start to sense a change in the air. Marker U is a hidden door that is surrounded by demonic looking masks. Once the party pours a bit of health potion near the masks the potion is drunk by the masks opening a hidden room.

The hidden room looks like this:

After the players leave the dungeon the following encounter ensues: 

The Amazing Anton's Affordable Adventuring Equipment. A traveling merchant selling mundane adventuring equipment of his own design and his body guard / man servant Grumble (Dwarf fighter)

As you head down the road you see a carriage approaching. It's being driven by a handsome young man with an extremely large and pointed mustache. You can see on a high perception check that he is studying the party through a long telescope. Next to him is a grumpy looking dwarf carrying a crossbow.

"AHOY!"

You see him stand up from his sitting position and retreats back into the carriage.

As the party walks by the carriage will unfold with a loud crash as the covering whips up into the form of an awning, the side folds down into the form of a stage, and sides fold out to reveal a small player harpsichord chiming away a plucky tune. The back wall is absolutely The back wall is absolutely covered with various items, a cross bow with a grappling hook where the bolt should be, a barrel full of sticks, a cage full of rats, etc.

Perception check, You see a tall lanky man in a cheap suit with an enormous green pointed mustache and top hat fidgeting nervously with a button.

Suddenly, smoke _POOF_ exlodes from the cart.

W-WELCOME MIGHTY ADVENTURERS!

The smoke clears and you can see the lanky man is barely holding his stage fright together as he tries to make a sales pitch.

You see a large sign in the back of the cart that says "The Amazing Anton's Affordable Adventuring Equipment LLC." which is flashing a little too eagerly.

"Thank the gods, the power of the fates that you have chanced upon my travelling storefront. I am The Amazing Anton and these are my premium goods. Might I interest you in a few items to aid in your noble quest?"

Tactirat - Rat in a cage with strap that can hold bombs, or a knife. Collapsable Expandable 10 foot pole Grappling hook crossbow Knife boot Belt with hidden dagger in belt buckle

None of these items are good. The grappling hook crossbow fires the hook 5 feet. The tactirats are completely untrained, the bombs are duds, the poles break easily.

After this the players head back with their cleric [[Chaelde.pdf]]

# Session 3
## Layout 
The party is in the city of [[Shinraal]] selling drugs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ. After finishing up the party is called into [[Mika's Library]] to study further into the masks they have found in the dungeon, now known as [[The Dungeon of Alphal]]. The masks were created by [[Alphal]], the first hand of [[Mika's Library]], to keep the souls of the other library staff's souls ready for [[Mika]]'s return from a long trip. There is a lead on [[Alphal]] in the town to the south called [[Craftery]], a small farming village, and a medium fishing town to the west called [[Pendalbor]].

If the players go to [[Craftery]]: There have been bug creatures attacking the town recently. The creatures are coming from the forest to the north. The creatures are coming from a dark tree that sounds like it's singing and spawns Adze every 5 turns. There is also a missing girl who is being looked for.

- Girl route:
	- The girl has been taken by a crazed man who lives in the forest. The man has been driven crazy by a strange song eminating from the heart of the forest.

After killing the tree (HP: 50) a hole is opened up underneath leading to a small chest holding an artifact known as the [[Singing Dead]], that forces a target, once per long rest, within a 18m radius to pass a DC 17 wis saving throw or else be confused and spawn a Adze. 

DM: This artifact was placed by [[Alphal]] to try to overrun this village.

If the party goes to [[Pendalbor]]:
A wizard is trying to sell a potion that he claims will heal any wound. This item only gives the look of health but if the user passes a DC 15 wis they can see it's actually doing nothing. The wizard knows of ruins further into the woods that might be of use to our mission. 

A small hut that contains a trap that forces players into a small room with a timer, a button and a set of gargoyle statues to the sides.
The room contains a simgle button and a timer set to ten minutes, if the players press the button the door opens, if they dont then the gargoyle statues animate and attack the players.
