As a child in a small village, Horston was a slow learner. Seeing that he was behind his peers in the ways of knowledge, he went hard on learning from the elders. He took an extra keen interest in language and magic. When he found out that there are any languages, he was ecstatic. Then he learned that languages can die when there aren't enough people actively speaking them. What horrific news. Horston knew his life's calling. He left his village, despite objection from his family, but at the urging of his favourite elder teacher. He now lives as an adventurer going from area to area, talking to the people to learn more about them, their culture, but most importantly, their language, and maybe taking some odd jobs. Horston has a tendency to get a little too involved in the locals and ends up on any variety of adventures. Along the way, he's been to many places and met and gotten involved with many people, so it's not unheard of for him to encounter people that know him, whether it be as friend or enemies.
