Chained men line the walls in shackles.

OBS 10 -> All of the men on the walls look like the life has been sucked out of them, pale faces but somehow look like they are very formidable fighters. All of them are wearing high collars

OBS 20 -> All of the men on the walls and the commander all have pricks on their necks, it looks like the pricks are being intentionally hidden with high collars and a skin tone paste
