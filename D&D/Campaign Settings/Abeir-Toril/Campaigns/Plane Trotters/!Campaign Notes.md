- Start with leveling up to level 4
- After level up players run are travelling by the [[Cragmaw Hideout]], up to the players to fight the goblins hidden there
- Once the players end up in [[Neverwinter]] they are hurried to the local church of Mysta; after the church fails to separate the group from the artifact known as Key (Tiny box Tim), they are given a quest to deliver the box to an ancient ruin to the east of the city where they will find the inactivate [[Mythallar]]. If the party activates the map to the [[Mythallar]] then a massive wave of magical energy is released. If a player fails a DC 18 constitution saving throw throw then they are paralyzed for a 
5 turns and take 2d6 radiant damage and are thrown back and thus knocked prone. Once the effect takes place an avatar of [[Shar]] takes over a serpentine skeleton.

The party gets to the fishing city of [[SIlverymoon]] and where the local fish population is disappearing. The fish population is getting killed off by a [[Troll Bloodseer]] who is trying to slowly kill off the population.![[Troll Bloodseer.jpg]]
A young woman moved in recently into the small fishing town of [[SIlverymoon]], this woman is raising suspicion due to no one knowing where she lives. Some villagers have tried to follow [[Alyssa Therelium]] back to her dwelling but only lost track of her and then running into large scuffed tracks. [[Alyssa Therelium]] was pushed out of her habitat in the [[Nether Mountains]]. If the players talk to it they can find out a few things about the creature that pushed her out: 
- The creature was cloaked in darkness itself
- The creature was female in shape
- 
- Didn't get too good of a look at the creature but got an overwhelming urge to get to safety

The party can also run into some new recruits of the [[Royal Corps of Monster Hunters|RCMH]], [[Dacian.pdf|Dacian]], [[Thana Dalmek.pdf|Thana]], and [[Borel.pdf|Borel]]. They are investigating a report of a suspected troll sighting.

After wrapping up business in [[SIlverymoon]] the party ends up on the road towards the citadel city of [[Sundabar]]. This city is one of the wealthiest and most militaristic cities within the nation of [[Luruar]]. Built similarly to a bastion the city is very well protected.

---
- Left off in the local inn in [[SIlverymoon]], a little girl is manning the inn, she's kinda weirded out by the fact that [[Butler]] just recharged at the socket behind the counter over night when there was a plug-in inside the rooms. The rooms are of average roadside-inn quality.
- Once the party departs town they travel about a days journey to the city of [[Sundabar]]
	- If the players enter a bar there is a very audaciously dressed man in the corner of the bar. Encounter: [[Johnald Humanman]]. If the players dont find him he can show up later during the race
	- The players will be told that the only way to get to the ruins at the heart of of [[Anauroch]] is by getting a guide. The only way to get a guide is to participate in the legendary "Desert Thunder Race" an annual race that the desert tribes ran every year. The race is to show which travellers are capable of traversing the desert along with the guide. Encounter: [[Desert Thunder Race]]
	-  There are a few tieflings in the city guard that used to be a part of their group as well; the tiefling [[Targa]] is trying to recreate the [[Bloodfire Moon]] ritual in the city of [[Sundabar]], she's doing this by seeding dissent in the [[Sundabar]]ian populace and slowly convincing the royalty that they need the power of the nine hells to maintain power.
		- [[Targa]] is contracted to the arch-devil [[Gargauth]], [[Bran]]'s father
	- There is a man in the city market who recognises [[Starlix]]'s form (Starlix's previous cell mate)
		- There is unrest growing from within the city's populace due to a string of murders of well known citizens; they are being murdered by an unknown group
			- **Lord Seraphin D'Arbonne** - Lord Seraphin was a prominent philanthropist in [[Sundabar]], known for his charitable work to aid the poor and underprivileged. His connection to Targa is that he had been secretly providing financial support to Targa and her fellow tieflings for years. Lord Seraphin's death was intended to create outrage and division, as his support for tieflings made him a symbol of hope for the marginalized.
			- **Rolan Tavernkeep** - Rolan was a beloved tavern owner in the city, operating the popular "Dancing Serpent Tavern." His establishment was known for fostering good relations between tieflings and other races, as he welcomed everyone regardless of their background. [[Targa]] used to work at the Dancing Serpent Tavern after escaping the hells, and Rolan acted as a father figure to him. His murder was meant to both divert suspicion from [[Targa]] and sow discord among different communities within the city.
			- **Alaric Thorne** - Alaric was a skilled enchanter known for creating magical trinkets and charms that benefited the community. His connection to [[Targa]] is that he had been secretly enchanting items for [[Targa]] and her fellow tieflings to aid their efforts. His murder was an attempt to disrupt the cooperation between the tiefling monster hunters and the local wizards, who were working on the defence of the city.
			- **Bryce Stonecreek** - Bryce Stonecreek is a nature enthusiast who often ventured into the wilderness to study the flora and fauna of the region and had discovered a hidden path in the nearby forest that could serve as an escape route for Targa and her fellow tieflings. His murder was intended to erase this escape route from the tieflings' knowledge, leaving them more vulnerable.
			- **Isolde Ravenshadow** - Isolde was a skilled healer who provided medical assistance to the less fortunate in Sundabar. Targa had received treatment from Isolde when he was injured, and Isolde had also helped tend to some of Targa's fellow escapees. His murder was designed to cut off this valuable resource from [[Targa]] and the other tieflings who sought medical care.
	- Murders
		- The murders are being committed by Targa due to their twisted ideals of how to bring about equality in the city of Sundabar. Targa is being manipulated by Nyxara so that the
