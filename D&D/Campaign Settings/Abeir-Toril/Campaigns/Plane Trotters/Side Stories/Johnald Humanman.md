**NPCs:** In the corner of the tavern, they notice a peculiar figure dressed in an ill-fitting, comically oversized human costume, attempting to blend in with the crowd. The Mindflayer, known as Johnald Humanman, wears a fake mustache that keeps sliding off, and a wig that barely conceals its wriggling tentacles.

**Goals and Motivations:** Johnald, a rogue Mindflayer with a quirky sense of humor, is on a mission to understand human customs and humor. Having stumbled upon a book of human jokes, Johnald is eager to try them out in real life, often resulting in awkward and amusing situations.

**Conflict Resolution:** As Johnald enthusiastically approaches the players to share his favorite jokes, the players must navigate through the awkward and sometimes cringe-worthy humor while trying not to offend the well-intentioned but socially awkward Mindflayer.

**Roleplaying Opportunities:** Encourage the players to participate in the comedic exchange, reacting to Johnald's failed attempts at humor with a mix of amusement and sympathy. They can also engage in lighthearted banter, sharing their own jokes and stories with Johnald.

**Reward:** If the players play along and humor Johnald, he might reward them with a peculiar trinket from his collection of oddities, such as a rubber chicken that emits a high-pitched squeak when squeezed, or a jar of pickled gelatinous cubes.

**Twists or Complications:** A group of local comedians, aware of Johnald's true identity, stage an impromptu comedy roast, gently poking fun at his clumsy attempts at human behavior. The players have the option to either support Johnald in his comedic endeavors or join the roasters in a good-natured jest, creating a memorable and light-hearted scene in the tavern.

This encounter injects humor into the game while allowing the players to engage with the whimsical and lighthearted side of a typically enigmatic and sinister creature. It also offers an opportunity for the players to bond with an unlikely character in a setting filled with laughter and good spirits.

the party enter a small tavern in a small town, likely looking for food and lodging. Also living in the inn is a mindflayer on the run from the militia. There are rumors that the local baron has been killed, which the party can learn with some careful conversation and questioning of the bars patrons. The do not mention any mindflayers though, just some of the common signs of a mindflayer attack. The party can either work with Johnald and help him escape the militia, or can aid the militia in their mission to kill the perpetrator of the Baron's killer. 

Asking the locals will reveal that the baron is not missed and was known for beheading political enemies. His son, however, is known to be a kind and just ruler that has fought with and for the people on many occasions, including against his father. 

Questioning Johnald will reveal that he has been living in the outskirts of the town, farming local crops and tending a small herd of sheep. He was once an illithid that was fully under the sway of the Elder Brain, but was beaten by a group of adventurers and left for dead. Instead, he awoke in a small hut, the Elder Brain finally silent, and with a long road to recover enough to take revenge on the party that beat him down. Under the hands of the half-elf healer, he healed quickly, but never again did the thought of revenge cross his mind. That very same healer that had saved him in the woods and mended his wounds, was soon the sole reason of Johnalds being. He did not leave the hut, staying in the arms of his healer, until the Baron's taxer arrived and took everything.
