Stat sheet: [[Bran.pdf]]

Siblings: None
Family: Was raised by his single mother. Branâ€™s father abandoned them.
Lifestyle: Modest. Grew up in a rundown shack in the outskirts of the city of [[Sundabar]].
Childhood: He spent most of his childhood alone, with no close friends. Due to his tall stature, he was put to work as a guard pretty early.
Background: Soldier
Motivation: Bran wished for fame and fortune, so he joined a mercenary company, selling his sword to the highest bidder.
Class: Barbarian
Origin: His anger needed to be channelled into battle, or he risked becoming an indiscriminate killer. Bran has nasty scars on his body, and is missing two toes. He's ambitious, scornful and sly. All alone he had to survive in a criminal world. But with his determination and persistence, he managed to overpower anybody who's a hindrance and escape hell. This has turned him into the man he is today. While constantly travelling the world, he now works fitting in with society. By doing so, he hopes to start life over on a good note and finally find friends he has never had.
