Stat sheet: [[Sparrow Cyno.pdf]]

Sparrow was born from human parents that lived near an old genie magic resivour. His parents were obviously shocked at his otherwordly appearance, so shocked that even the people around them dubbed Sparrow a demonic entity and a bringer of bad luck. After a  few years and a few normal looking children later, his family believed it too. So they dumped their child near the poorests districts of the city. The [[Plague Rats]] took him in after he almost got away with stealing from them.
