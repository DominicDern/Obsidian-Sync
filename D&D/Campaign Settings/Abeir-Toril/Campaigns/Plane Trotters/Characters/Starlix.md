My character is a Changeling presenting as a tiefling, and id like to keep that a secret from the party at first. He is a wrongfully convicted murderer on the run, and the form he has taken is the face of his cellmate after he was taken into custody who was executed. The man he was convicted of murdering was his adoptive father who taught him to play music (trumpet), which he now does as a performance for money. After escaping prison, he went on to live life as a pirate for a few years before settling in the lower end of the city where he now lives.
