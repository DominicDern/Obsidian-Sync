Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-­term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

| Level | Effect                                                     |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | [[Disadvantage]] on [[Ability Checks\|ability checks]]                             |
| 2     | [[Speed]] is halved                                            |
| 3     | [[Disadvantage]] on [[Attack Rolls]] and [[Saving Throws]]             |
| 4     | Maximum [[Hit Points]] is halved                               |
| 5     | [[Speed]] is reduced to 0                                      |
| 6     | Death                                                      |

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
