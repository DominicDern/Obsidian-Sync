The **creator races** were a group of five legendary ancient races native to [[Abeir-Toril]]  who were prominent during the [[Days of Thunder]] (−35,000 DR to −30,000 DR and who gave rise to many of the common races of the world. They were also capitalized as the Creator Races or called simply the Creators. In the [[Elven language]], they were known as the Iquar-Tel'Quessir or Iquar'Tel'Quessir or iquar Tel'Quessir, all meaning "Creator Races", as recorded in at least one text, but it was unknown if this derived from a title the creator races gave themselves or a mistranslation by human scholars or its [[Half-efl|half-elf]] author. Either way, the term was not meant to carry honor or respect.
