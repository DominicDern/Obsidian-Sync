A **phylactery** was the name given to the repository used to store the life force of a [[Lich|lich]]. A [[Cleric|cleric]] or [[Mage|mage]] had to create such a phylactery in order to become a [[Lich|lich]]  and it was necessary for the [[Lich|lich]] to maintain its [[Undead|undead]] state and escape being destroyed. Phylacteries were also employed by [[Dracolich|dracoliches]] and [[Demilich|demiliches]]. Every phylactery was unique, in nature, defense, and means of destruction.
