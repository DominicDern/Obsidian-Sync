A lich, sometimes called a lichnee, was an almost universally evil form of [[Undead|undead]] spellcaster of great power, usually a [[Wizard|wizard]], but also possibly a [[Sorcerer|sorcerer]], [[Warlock|warlock]], or [[Cleric|cleric]]. Liches were feared by mortal beings for their malign magic, their intelligence, and their willingness to embrace undeath for a chance to live foreverâ€”or rather, to _endure_ forever. Lichdom was arguably the most powerful known form of undeath.
