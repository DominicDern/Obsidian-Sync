# What is cost management in the [[Microsoft Azure|Azure Cloud Services]] ecosystem?
Cost Management provides the ability to quickly check [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources. Cost analysis is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] costs. Using cost analysis, you can quickly view the total cost in a variety of different ways, including by billing cycle, region, resource, and so on. You use cost analysis to explore and analyze your organizational costs. You can view aggregated costs by organization to understand where costs are accrued and to identify spending trends. And you can see accumulated costs over time to estimate monthly, quarterly, or even yearly cost trends against a budget.
## Cost Alerts 
Cost alerts provide a single location to quickly check on all of the different alert types that may show up in the Cost Management service. The three types of alerts that may show up are:
- [[Budget Alerts|Budget alerts]]
- [[Credit Alerts|Credit alerts]]
- [[Department Spending Quota Alerts|Department spending quota alerts]]

A budget is where you set a spending limit for Azure. You can set budgets based on a subscription, resource group, service type, or other criteria. When you set a budget, you will also set a budget alert. When the budget hits the budget alert level, it will trigger a budget alert that shows up in the cost alerts area. If configured, budget alerts will also send an email notification that a budget alert threshold has been triggered.

A more advanced use of budgets enables budget conditions to trigger automation that suspends or otherwise modifies resources once the trigger condition has occurred.
## Examples of use
Microsoft Azure is a global cloud provider, meaning you can provision resources anywhere in the world. You can provision resources rapidly to meet a sudden demand, or to test out a new feature, or on accident. If you accidentally provision new resources, you may not be aware of them until itâ€™s time for your invoice. Cost Management is a service that helps avoid those situations.
