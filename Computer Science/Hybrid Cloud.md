A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both [[Public Cloud|public]] and [[Private Cloud|private]] clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a [[Private Cloud|private cloud]] to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying [[Public Cloud|public cloud]] resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in [[Public Cloud|public cloud]] and which to deploy to their [[Private Cloud|private cloud]] infrastructure.
