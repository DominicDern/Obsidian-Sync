The TCO calculator is designed to help you compare the costs for running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an [[Microsoft Azure|Azure Cloud]] infrastructure. With the TCO calculator, you enter your current infrastructure configuration, including servers, databases, storage, and outbound network traffic. The TCO calculator then compares the anticipated costs for your current environment with an [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] environment supporting the same infrastructure requirements. With the TCO calculator, you enter your configuration, add in assumptions like power and IT labor costs, and are presented with an estimation of the cost difference to run the same environment in your current datacenter or in [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]].
