There are a few types of clouds when talking about [[Cloud Computing]], cloud models are used to describe what and when to use different types of clouds.

| [[Private Cloud]]                                                  | [[Hybrid Cloud]]                                                  | [[Public Cloud]]                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organizations have complete control over resources and security    | Provides the most flexibility                                     | No capital expenditures to scale up                                   |
| Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data              | Organizations determine where to run their applications           | Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned             |
| Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance             | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements | Organizations pay only for what they use                              |
| Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates |                                                                   | Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security |

# Other types of cloud models
## Multi-cloud
In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

## Azure Arc
Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your data-center, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

## Azure VMware Solution
What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.
