With the consumption based model you only pay for what you use. Services that run under the consumption based model fall under the definition of [[Operational Expenditure]] as many services selling services with this model have already finished many of the required tasks that would require [[Capital Expenditure]] and the only expenses left are only [[Running Costs]]. A good example of a product that uses the consumption based model could be [[Microsoft Azure]], it shifts development costs from the [[Capital Expenditure|CapEx]] of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an [[Operational Expenditure|OpEx]] of renting infrastructure as you need it, whether itâ€™s compute, storage, networking, and so on.
